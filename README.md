#### Problem to Solve:
Access to healthcare in rural Kenya is often limited due to distance, lack of healthcare professionals, and poor communication infrastructure. A potential problem to solve could be scheduling and managing teleconsultations with doctors for remote patients.

Track Patient History to manage follow-up appointments and referrals.
#### Features of the CLI:
Appointment Scheduling:

Data Sharing:
Upload and share medical summaries securely with healthcare providers.
Manage patient history using simple commands.
Health Guidelines:
