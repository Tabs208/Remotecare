# Project: RemoteCare CLI
## Problem Statement:
In remote rural areas, access to emergency medical assistance is often delayed due to poor communication, lack of infrastructure, and limited availability of healthcare providers. Thereâ€™s also a lack of a streamlined way to log and prioritize emergencies.
### Solution:
Build a **Command-Line Tool** called RemoteCare CLI to:
Allow community health workers or locals to **log medical emergencies.**
**Prioritize emergencies** based on severity levels.
Notify nearby healthcare facilities (via SMS/email integration).
Generate **offline health guides** for basic first aid.
#### Core Features
**1.Log Medical Emergencies:**
Input patient details, location, symptoms, and severity level.
Save these logs locally in a JSON file or lightweight database (e.g., SQLite).
**example:** bash remotecare log --name "John Doe" --symptoms "Severe chest pain" --location "Village A" --severity "High"

**2.Prioritize Cases:**
Sort and display logged cases by severity (High > Medium > Low). 
**example:** bash remotecare prioritize

**3.Notify Healthcare Centers:**
Generate a summary of emergency cases and send them via email or SMS to nearby healthcare providers.
Integration options:
Use Twilio for SMS notifications.
Use an SMTP server (e.g., Gmail) for email.

**4.Offline First Aid Guide:**
Provide text-based first aid instructions for common emergencies like burns, fractures, or fevers:
**example** bash remotecare guide --topic "burns"
**output**
First Aid for Burns:
- Cool the burn under running water for at least 10 minutes.
- Cover the burn with a clean, non-fluffy cloth.
- Do not apply creams or lotions.
